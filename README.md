## Background
*What can I do to improve the quality of life in Shanghai?*

My team spent the first several weeks discussing possible approaches to the problem. Our final decision was to focus on healthcare. We figure that one of the major concerns in the modern Chinese society is of health. Many people lack the scientific knowledge in medicine, resulting in issues such as refusing to take prescriptions, consuming expired drugs, or not following the recommended dose. A brief survey targeting the elderly in Shanghai shows that most are unaware of the importance of a “medication or treatment cycle” (especially for antibiotics). This finding is shocking; we all know that such carelessness poses dangerous health risks and may lead to severe consequences. My team is then determined to do something to promote the awareness of a healthy lifestyle.

With the aim to first correct the use of medication, then to spread knowledge on health and safety, our ultimate goal is to convert people into informed citizens, thus increasing the quality of life in Shanghai. My team came up with several measures we could take to accomplish this goal, such as making lectures in the community, filming videos, posting articles, or creating a website. However, there are disadvantages associated with each one. Finally, to maximize functionality, we chose to take a rather challenging path—to develop a standalone mobile application.

## Features
The application has three pages, serving three functions. On the home page, there will be health-related news articles, health tips, and other information such as details about the coronavirus. Moving on, we also have a medication page. On this page, we have built a “home medicine recorder,” which allows users to record the various drugs they have at home. The application will pop up a notification when the drug is expired, prompting users to discard the drug properly and purchase new ones. Another function is the “medicine-intake reminder,” which allows users to input their drug-intake schedule. At a specific time of the day, the application will pop up a notification. Lastly, we have the knowledge page. At this stage, my team is developing an interactive simulation (like a game) for people to learn first aid. By following the onscreen instructions, users can get a hands-on experience carrying out first aid, in contrast to traditional means like reading articles or watching videos.

## Brief history
HomePharmacist was initiated in 2019 as part of the author's Grade 11 Junior Project. It was developed in collaboration with Jonathan Hua, Soonmin Kwon, Cato Wen, Benjamin Xiao, and Antonio Gai. As of 2020, the software is open sourced but is no longer maintained.
